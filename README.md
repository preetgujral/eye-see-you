## Concept
When visitors walk under the sculpture, the pattern changes to blue background with white lights reflecting the location and amount of motion happening. After visitors walk away the lights go back to a twinkling star pattern. Webcam is located above the light installation. Created using Arduino, Processing, NeoPixel  LEDs (WS2812b), and Teensy.
